# Stock-Price-Forecasting-Using-LSTM-Neural-Networks
This project develops LSTM-based deep learning models to forecast stock prices for GE and Apple Inc. It compares multi-step direct and recursive forecasting approaches across short- and long-term horizons, experimenting with model architectures, loss functions, and optimizers to optimize prediction accuracy and stability.
